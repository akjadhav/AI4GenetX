# AI4GenetX

## **ABSTRACT**

This project improves the early detection of rare craniofacial genetic disorders, like Down Syndrome and Williams Syndrome, through Deep Convolutional Neural Networks using facial images. The early detection of rare craniofacial genetic disorders is crucial for the management/treatment of associated medical complications and health issues. This project focuses mainly on Down Syndrome and Williams Syndrome. Studies have found that the current screening tests are not adequate, and in many cases, detection is missed until a few years after the child is born. A new system, named AI4GenetX, was developed to predict whether a child has a rare craniofacial genetic disorder from simple facial images. This system uses Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with real-time facial detection and tracking implementation. The new system achieved an accuracy of 92.3%.
